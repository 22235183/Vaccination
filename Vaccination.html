            <h2>Vacination Rate</h2>
                <p>The policy introduced by the government is quite useful</p>
                <p>Population that has been vaccinated for the first time: <mark>6897936 (94.5%)</mark></p>
                <p>Population that has been vaccinated for the second time: <mark>6759853 (92.7%)</mark></p>
                <p>Population that has been vaccinated for the third time: <mark>5712317 (82.1%)</mark></p>
            <h2>Is the policy of vaccination effective to combate Covid-19?</h2>
                <p>Undoubtedly, the policy increased rate of vaccination.</p>
                <p>This is the most effective way to prevent disease. </p>
                <p>The principle of the vaccine is to inject the antigen or genetic material of the virus or bacteria into the human body, stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies,</p> 
                <p>so that when it is actually exposed to the pathogen, it can quickly produce an immune response and reduce the incidence of infection, severe disease and death</p>
                <p>Getting vaccinated not only prevents you from getting sick, but also prevents you from spreading the disease to those around you. </p>
                <p>When most people in the group are vaccinated, the spread of COVID-19 will be greatly reduced, so that everyone can be protected anytime and anywhere, and work and live normally</p>
